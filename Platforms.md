This document lists the platforms that should be supported, and
outlines how to have them supported.


### Target platforms ###

Anything on branch `master` should be stable and support at least the
following platforms:
 -  Windows (XP SP3 and up);
 -  Mac OS X (10.5 and up);
 -  Ubuntu (10.04 and up, as well as equivalent Mint distributions).

Exceptions are possible, please discuss such cases with the others.

More platforms can be added if testers are available. Let us know if
you want to test for a new platform.


### Ensuring that your program supports these platforms ###

When you think it's time to merge your stuff into master, [submit an
issue to the main project on
GitHub](https://github.com/the-xkcd-community/the-red-spider-project/
issues). Tell us where we can find your branch and which platforms
still need to be tested. When your branch appears all clear, merge it
into your own master branch and submit a pull request.


### Reporting failing platform support ###

If you find that something on the master branch doesn't support your
platform while it should, please submit an issue.
